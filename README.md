Little spinning chicken going through space and other locations.

The little chicken can follow your mouse's vertical position. "Shooting Star" by Bag Raiders plays while the background images randomly changes. The background change interval is designed to be changed at the same beats per minute as the song.

This was my second project using p5.js.
